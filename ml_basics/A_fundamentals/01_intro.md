# Intro

## Differences: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

### Artificial Intelligence

"The effort to automate intellectual task normally performed by humans". Formal definition does not point to the thinking capability for a structured computational architectures (or symply computers), but recent discussions are growing to the awarness property posibility into a machine. This way of thinking could distord the original meaning of the category.

It could be considered as a masive universal set of all another topics in relation to it, in other words, its considered that "Artificial Inteligence" contain all subjects.

### Machine Learning

Its a method that focus on the use of data to imitate the way that humans learn using a machine learning algorithm, in a general perspective is an alternative to model behaviour throught wirting rules, instead data will model the rules.
